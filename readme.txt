This plugin will help you to copy a widget with just a click.


== Description ==

If you want to copy a widget this plugin can help you. You can duplicate the widget with just one click.

This plugin will make your work faster if you need more widgets with the same type.

Open a widget and inside the widget just click Replicate button and the widget will be replicated.

The action is the same as dragging a new widget from the widgets list.

For example you have an Image widget, and you want to add more Image widgets below, you just click Replicate button as many times as you need.

This plugin can be an alternative to Widget Clone.

IMPORTANT: I plan to make this plugin work on the Customize page too but I don't know how, if you can help me I will be very glad.
